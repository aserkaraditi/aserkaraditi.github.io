							<p>Product Customizations</p>
							<p>As Senior Product Consultant, I was responsible for the technical implementation and customization of the temenos product suitable for the business that we were working with</p>
							<p>The below were the changes made as part of it:</p>
							<p> 1. Customize the product UI to fit the need of the client - This involved working on the TAP scripting to add a feature or add a constraint to the feature<br> 2. User Defined Field creation - This involved modifying the existing database structure provided by temenos to fit the additional need of the customer (For example creating a drop down/permitted value for a field in the tool UI) by following a standard procedure given by Temenos.<br> 3. Product Integration - This involved creating components in IBM WTX to take data from various sources - Back office which is responsible for sending static (portfolio, instrument etc) and dynamic data(transactions etc) in different file formats (csv, json, excel, API etc) and converting it into a format acceptable by the product</p>

							<h2 class="major">Academic Project -UTD Rides-  UTD</h2>
							
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/UTDrides.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<p>Objective: <br>
								Hence it would be great to have an alternative to the above. One of the possible solutions is to
								create a carpooling system.<br>
								1. To build a carpooling application for UTD students. Carpool is revolutionary and fun way
								to commute. Great way to make connections and ensure secure rides. A secure ride can
								be ensured by checking the student ID of the students with graduation date and driving
								license of the drivers additionally.<br>
								2. Whether you are a car owner or a rider, just post your ride details on application, the
								date and the route of the ride and it will match you with co-riders on your way.
								3. If the same route is not available, suggest a ride in the nearby location for the same
								timeslot.</p>

								<p>Scope:<br>
									1. Estimated cost is approximately $7000 for the entire system.<br>
									2. Time needed for completion is estimated to be 6 months.<brre database se>
									3. The development of the website and application would requirvers to hold
									the data of the riders and the ride details<br>
									4. The system would require severs to calculate and match the rides in the same/nearby
									area.<br>
									5. The system would also fetch data from GPS to find the passengers in the nearby area.</p>
