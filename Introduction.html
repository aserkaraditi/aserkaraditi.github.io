								Hey there! Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio.<br><br>My name is Aditi Aserkar, and I am currently pursuing my MS in Information Technology & Management at The University of Texas at Dallas (Expected graduation date - December 2023). Before this, I worked as a consultant for a Portfolio & Wealth Management product, delivering work to clients across Europe in an agile manner using various technologies and tools.
								<br><br>
								I am extremely passionate about Product Management and Data Analytics, and I am constantly learning new skills and tools that will help me move my career forward in these fields. In the future, I aspire to move into management roles. When I'm not studying or working, I love to travel and experience different cultures. I truly believe that meeting new people from different backgrounds and cultures helps to broaden our perspectives and realize that the world is smaller than we think.
								<br><br>
								Last year, I left a stable career in the Netherlands and moved to the USA to seek new opportunities and challenges. I am always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the organizations I work with. So, if you're looking for a proactive, quick learner, and resourceful team player who always delivers, please feel free to connect with me.</p>
