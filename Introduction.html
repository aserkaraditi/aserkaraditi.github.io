							<p>As an experienced IT professional with a passion for Data Analytics/Engineering, Product Management, and Travel, I am currently pursuing a Master's in Information Technology & Management from the University of Texas at Dallas to further enhance my profile.

								With almost 7 years of hands-on experience in a variety of technologies and tools, including Temenos Triple A Plus, ODATA, IBM WTX, Unix/Linux shell scripting, SQL/Sybase, Mainframe Scheduler, and programming languages like C/C++/JAVA/Python, I have honed my skills and expertise in these areas.<br><br>
								
								Driven by my curiosity and desire to stay ahead of the curve, I am constantly learning and implementing cutting-edge technologies such as Data Engineering, Cloud Computing with AWS, Big Data using Hadoop HDFS/Hive/Spark, Project Management, and Data Visualization.<br><br>
								
								I have a proven track record of success working with Agile methodologies and leading teams to success, and my experience working with clients on-site has given me an appreciation for different cultures and taught me to strike a healthy work-life balance.<br><br>
								
								I am actively seeking new and exciting opportunities in the USA (Internships/Full-Time) related to Data Analytics/Engineering, Software/Development Engineering, Project Management, or Product Consulting.
